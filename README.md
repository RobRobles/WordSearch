WordSearch
==========

This is a WordSearch game, enter in your own words and the scramble the board and start looking! 

I worked little with Java swing so I did my best. Basically I have a n x n grid of spaces for individual letters. How it works:
1. Select the direction you want the word to be placed H (Horizontally), V (Vertically), or D (Diagonally). 
2. Type in the word you want on the board. 
3. Hit the submit button after typing in each word. 
4. When your finished hit the finish button.
5. Next a scramble button will appear, hit that button to scramble the rest of the board. 
6. A list will apprear as you enter in each word in the upper right hand corner. 
7. When your done you can print it out and start looking for the words, or reset the board and start over.
